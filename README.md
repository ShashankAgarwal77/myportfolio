- When i start my web development journey i really love creating static websites using HTML, CSS and JS
- At that time, i create my first portfolio website for my static websites portfolio [My First Portfolio Website](https://shashankagarwal.netlify.app)
- But it was static to include any project and I have to create more HTML pages and edit everytime include any new project in the core codebase
- So, I decided to create my Portfolio Website to link with Headerless CMS
- After Learning about ReactJS and Headerless CMS More, I start working on my Project
