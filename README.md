# My Portfolio Website Documentation

![Homepage of Portfolio](./src/header-image.png)

- When i start my web development journey i really love creating static websites using HTML, CSS and JS
- At that time, i create my first portfolio website for my static websites portfolio [My First Portfolio Website](https://shashankagarwal.netlify.app)
- But it was static to include any project and I have to create more HTML pages and edit everytime include any new project in the core codebase
- So, I decided to create my Portfolio Website Dynamic So I just include my projects using Content Mangement System.

- I start Learn More about Headerless CMS to integrate my front-end with Headless CMS
- What **Headerless Content Management System** really do ?
- It basically acts as an content repository which can be accessible _via_ an API for display on any device.

- After Learning about ReactJS and Headerless CMS More, I start working on my Project

### My Technology Stack

1. [React.js](https://reactjs.org) - To create resuable UI Components
2. [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-studio) - Open Source CMS built with React.js
3. [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - Designed to be component friendly

4. Using **React.js** for building Frontend Application is an great option to create single page applications
5. All the content is Mangaged by **Sanity Studio**

- Which is great option to add or remove content such as Posts and Projects

3. All the Styling is done by the **Tailwind CSS** which is really handy to create fast and good accessible design using shorthand style coding.

## How it Started

- First, Setting the ReactJS setup using `npx create-react-app myportfolio`
- `npx` helps to grab the package with latest version instead of using `npm install -g` and then use `create-react-app` to create react application then name of the project as `myportfolio`
